**Wireless IOT Features**
> Feature selection is based on wireless DataLink layer header information.

|Features	| Description|
|---|---|
|Version |	Radiotap Frame control field indicates the current WLAN protocol version.|

|Rate |	Data transfer rate of a device i.e. 2.0 Mb/s etc.| 
|ChannelFrequency |	Device operating channel frequency i.e. radio wave spectrum type a,b,g,n |
|ChannelFlags |	Specifies device supported spectrum coding method designed to avoid collision.|
|DBM_AntSignal |	Transmitting wireless device radio antenna strength in dBm.|
|Antenna |	Number of available transceiving radio antennas.|
|Subtype |	Specified the frame sub type i.e. association request (0000), association response (0001), beacon (1000), probe request (0100) etc.|
|Type |	Determine the function of frame type i.e. management (00), control (01) or data (10).|  
|Proto	| WLAN Protocol version.|
|FCfield	| Specifies wireless frame flag i.e. to-DS, from-DS, retry, power, protected, etc.|

 ######################## TCP IOT ##############################

Library Module name : iot()

Example:
 
    from cybersectk.iot import iot
 
    iot()
 
OUTPUT File: label_feature_IOT.CSV

NOTE: We need to create two different directories original_pcap and filtered_pcap in a working directory. The source iot pcap file need to be available inside the original_pcap directory. 
The library uses tshark to extract the features from the given TCP pcap file. Make sure tshark is installed on your system. 
A python dictionary ip_filter {} is used to filter device specific TCP PCAP files at the time of execution. The filtered pcap file will be save with its fileted name inside filtered_pcap directory.

Available Dictionary ip_filter keys
TCP_Mobile

TCP_Outlet

TCP_Assistant

TCP_Camera

TCP_Miscellaneous

Dictionary key value pair example:

ip_filter['TCP_Miscellaneous'] = '"tcp && (ip.src==192.168.1.216) || (ip.src==192.168.1.46) || (ip.src==192.168.1.84) \
                     || (ip.src==192.168.1.91)"'

Please update dictionary key and value. 

Example: ip_filter = {} 

    ip_filter['TCP_Miscellaneous'] = '"tcp && (ip.src==IP_Address)"'
         
    iot (**ip_filter)

|TCPflags |	Specifies the particular state of TCP connection, fields use like SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, etc. |
|TCPChecksum	| Detect corruption in TCP packed payload and the header.|

######################### MALEWARE #############################

Library function name : malware()

Example:
 
    from cybersectk.malware import malware
 
 malware()
 
    OUTPUT File : DynamicMalwareMatrix.CSV

Note: Please make sure to creat directory "log_files" in a same working directory and add the Good and infected CSV log files inside log_files directory for feature extraction. Make sure to name Good1.CSV, Good2.CSV and so on for the non malicious system log files. Please refer to the sample data set for better understanding. 

Plese download the sample dataset from the Link below.

########################## PHISH ###############################

Library function name: 

    phish(email=None, password=None, server=None, l=False, mailbox=None, process=1)

The phish function produces a personal corpus of phishing features 
extracted from an IMAP server of the user's choice, for example Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail.

Example:
 
    from cybersectk.phish import phish

To list IMAP directories: 
 
    phish('yuri@example.com', 'yourapppassword', 'imap.gmail.com', True)

To process email messages:

    phish('yuri@example.com', 'yourapppassword', 'imap.gmail.com', False, '[Gmail]/Spam', 25)
 
Parameters:

    email    (str):  Email login. Required.
    password (str):  Email password. Note, modern email services require app passwords. Required.
    server   (str):  IMAP server. This method connects via SSL port 993 only. Required.
    l        (bool): List IMAP mailboxes to console for use with next argument. Required.
    mailbox  (str):  Mailbox to use. Optional if l = True, else required.
    process  (int):  Number of emails to process. Default: 1, Max: 100.

Returns:

    None

Output:

    CSV. File will be placed in current working directory containing various phishing 
    feature extractions. The filename is dynamic to support multiple runs of this function. 
    Filename will be a combination of email address provided to function and current 
    date time stamp. Additionally, each message email processed will be placed in a "msg"
    folder at the root of the CyberSecTK folder hierarchy. 
 
NOTE1: Gmail, Hotmail/Outlook and Yahoo! Mail all require an "app password". See this link for
an example - https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833  

NOTE2: Be sure to review and update the phishing_terms file as required for your effort.
